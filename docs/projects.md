# projects

- I usually start with [tasks](todo.md) which sometimes spawn folders
- folders usually are within the main project folde but sometimes are outside it
- if the project folder spawned is somewhere else I will add a code block to open it locally
- example `code ~/wherever/` or a url or shared network folder or cloud resource
- `projects.md` is optional for whatever you can use it or delete it
- usually it's code blocks used for local development
- an index of scattered information related to the project
- etc.
