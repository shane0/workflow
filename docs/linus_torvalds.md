## data structure dictates code

- <https://medium.com/webdevops/data-structures-548cbea9c520>

I’m a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it’s one of the reasons git has been fairly successful… I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.

### good data structure

### examples

- Eric Raymond’s “Rule of Representation” from 2003:
- Fold knowledge into data, so program logic can be stupid and robust.
