# alias shortcuts

- apps in this template have aliases documented on their mkdoc page
- click commands I add typically call an alias so they click is optional 

## alias workflow

- this seems obvious I'm surprised it's not included in .bashrc from day 1
- ea: edit alias file
- sa: updates aliases (sa = source alias)

```sh
-8<- "bash_aliases:0:4"
```

- when editing aliases use: <https://www.shellcheck.net/>
