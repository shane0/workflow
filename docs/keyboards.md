## programmable keyboards

- A PROGRAMMABLE KEYBOARD CAN MOVE A KEY TO YOUR FINGER
- a stupid keyboard makes you move a finger to the key
- or worse to the mouse or a numpad
- you can have layers of keys 

## why todays keyboards are absurd

- your keyboard was designed by morons decades ago
- the keys are all slanted this way \\\\\\\\
- hands slant this way ///// \\\\\
- humans rose to the top of the food chain because of thumbs
- thumbs are like this / \
- but your space bar is like this __________
- your thumbs are not reaching their full potential
- the reason the keys are slanted is a problem introduced by mechanical typewriters
- someone moved all the keys randomely because there were metal bars under the keys
- a real solution should have been to move the bars not the keys 
- computers are digital now there are no bars!
