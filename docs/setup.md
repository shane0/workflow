# setup

- this repo has `dotfiles/` with some setup scripts

## linux

- if you use linux you are smarter than me and already know how to setup
- I used to use linux & will return someday

## macos

- I currently use this on macos & can assist if you get stuck
- install <https://brew.sh/>
- once that is setup you can use it to install git, pyenv + python, etc.
