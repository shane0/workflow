# tech lock for dummies

- see solutions below someday I'll make a dedicated site with just solutions

## blahblahblah

- have you ever noticed after a software update something broke or a feature was removed or moved around or renamed?
- have you ever used software so difficult to use you had to purchase training or books?
- have you ever had a job that required passing tests that were awkward or cost money to take or to prepare for?
- have you ever been sent a file you cannot open on your computer?
- because the person had a different type of computer than you?
- or because they used some software that requires a purchase?
- have you ever bought something to fix something and the part did not fit?
- have you ever shopped for replacement windshield wipers and noticed there are 9 billion different types that are all a simple strip of rubber?
- tech lock happens when a weak ingorant person intentionally breaks a product
- intuition should tell you how to identify it
- emotionally you can recognize this by noting rising levels of frustration
- or productivity drops
- or costs increase for no reason
- or solving issues does not happens or takes enormous amounts of time
- there are obtuse and subtle ways this happens
- to strengthen "their" corporation
- this is a global issue
- overall it slows down progress for humanity
- makes our species weak
- this is a maladaptation
- a form of infighting
- patents laws trademarks etc.

## how to not be dumb

- teach people bout tech lock in
- a logical conversation to avoid tech lock applies any of the pest topics
- pest: politics economics social technical
- adults have a hard time understanding this elementary concept
- this should be taught in grade 1 or 2
- sharing used to be in elementary school
- do not use products with tech lock in
- do not creating products with tech lock in

## people who defend tech lock in

- the only people that defend this have incorrect views
- they are someone who profits from the problem
- they are related or paid by someone who profits
- or they are just mentally ill greedy needy
- or other dramatic and illogical reasons

## why does tech lock in happen?

- tech lock in is a social issue
- it stems from fear, mental illness, insecurity and other kleshas
- there are many foolish ways to "accomplish" this
- one is to make your technology excessively complicated
- there are many foolish ways to "accomplish"  excessively complicated  software
- making software complicated

- when humans are weakened by three poisons
- in buddhism there are 3 main poisons
- ignroance greed and hate
- tech lock is a symptom of individuals
- mundane ordinary ignorance
- humanities weakest individuals
- it degrades quality

## preventing repairs

- another way is to prevent the user from maintaining the product
- the original rolls royce vehicles had a lock on the hood only the factory could open bypassing it voided your warranty
- there are ongoing court cases with  farming equipment
- john deer and other brands will break farming equipment
- a message appears on screen requiring a paid tech come unlock the product
- this can be for mundane issues a child could fix

## prevents technology from functioning

- expiring warranties
- using a subscription vig pay model
- app stores
- amazon remove the book 1984 from kindle
- to make it worse they did not refund the purchase
- basically they repeated a habit humans have of "burning books"
- a form of censorship
- redbox just plain shut down
- there were users with 5 figure purchases that lost everything they purchased
- or they just kill a product <https://killedbygoogle.com/>
- usually the reason for killing a product is tech lock in
- often they shut down things that are the most useful
- because they want to start over and build it with more monetization

## childish patents

- adults fight over things using patents
- overall it slows down progress for humanity

## certifcation

- for a while there were computer certificates you could buy
- they were notorious for having test questions with multiple "right" answers
- a way that works and a "<insert company mame> way" that you would not know unless you paid for special proprietary test preparation classes or books or even subscription based training?
- this also happens in tech interviews, there are sites and software corporations use to exclude people unless they know the latest questions that you only see if you pay various tech training interview prep sites

## requiring additional purchases

- disabling a feaature that is useful & licening pieces of products

## more examples

- medical software that requires expensive hardware or software
- gets cut when executives cut budgets
- dies or is killed intentionally by the provider
- remember political parties recieve billions every year from corporations
- government involvement often forces tech lock in in multiple industries
- legislation gets passed requiring purchases or accreditation
- software i have seen with updates with breaking changes
- az cli
- azure keyvault library
- oracle db
- enforced specific programming language requirements
- some software companies are owned and ran by non technical people
- they buy software just to kill it to monopolize or otherwise dominate an industry

## solutions

- the easiest thing is to stay in the command line and stick with a few programming languages
- linus torvalds built the kernel and git all he has installed on his laptop is a terminal and a browser
- this site is packed with solutions

## other rackets

- this is a story in itself
- a racket is when a group creates a problem to sell a fake solution
- this is how the mafia would operate
- mob tells thieves what businesses they can rob
- theives give the mob their cut
- the mob comes in demands money for "protection"
- this poison has infected every nation and global corporation
- pollution is particularly profitable
- think about this: anytime there is a problem and things went wrong, something broke, lost luggage, disasters, medical problems, food shortages, any scarcity or any inconvenience people fork out money to get rid of, often has a racket surrounding it
- why is this?  when anything becomes more expensive that generates profit, someone collects more when something is expensive
- example: overall tax collection, everything is taxed so when any process becomes more expensive then more tax is collected
- example: global investors, take lost luggage, i recently had this happen and it seems to be a growing problem, an entire plane full of luggage had to be shipped overnight, global investors invest accross the board so they profit any time something costs more overall so they intentionally or unintentionally create problems
- example: non profits which are often hospitals who grandfathered in non profit status due to originally being religious charity organizations will spend money for no other reason than to perpetuate their budget otherwise a given departments annual budget drops

## use-it-or-lose-it budgeting

### Explanation

Organizations, particularly those with annual budgets, may have funds that do not roll over to the next fiscal year. If the allocated budget is not fully spent, the unspent amount might lead to reduced allocations in the following year. To avoid this, departments or teams often rush to spend leftover funds on unnecessary items or services before the fiscal year ends, even if the expenses aren't essential.

### Example Contexts

- **Government and Public Sector:** Departments might spend on office supplies, technology upgrades, or unneeded contracts to avoid future budget cuts.
- **Corporate Settings:** Teams may purchase equipment or organize events late in the year to use their remaining funds.

This behavior can lead to **inefficiency** and **waste**, as the spending is driven by budgetary incentives rather than organizational needs.

## planned obsolescence

### Explanation

Planned obsolescence involves designing products with a limited useful life or ensuring that certain components are incompatible with future models. This strategy encourages consumers to purchase new products more frequently, boosting sales but often frustrating customers and generating more waste.

### Types of Planned Obsolescence

1. **Technical Incompatibility:** Designing parts or accessories (like chargers or components) so they won't work with newer versions of the product.
   - **Example:** Changing connector designs to force consumers to buy new accessories.
2. **Perceived Obsolescence:** Updating designs or features to make older models appear outdated, even if they're still functional.
   - **Example:** Cosmetic changes that encourage style-conscious consumers to upgrade.
3. **Limited Repairability:** Making products hard or expensive to repair, pushing customers to buy replacements instead.
   - **Example:** Using proprietary screws or sealing components to prevent easy fixes.

Planned obsolescence is often criticized for being anti-consumer and environmentally harmful, leading to movements advocating for **"right to repair"** and sustainable design practices.

## perverse incentives or profit-driven problem perpetuation

### Explanation

Perverse incentives occur when organizations or industries have financial motivations to maintain or exacerbate a problem rather than solve it. Solving the problem would eliminate the source of ongoing profits, so the incentive structure discourages resolution.

### Examples

1. **Healthcare:** A focus on treatments rather than cures because chronic illnesses generate recurring revenue.
2. **Planned Obsolescence:** Designing products to wear out prematurely so customers must buy replacements.
3. **Environmental Issues:** Companies profiting from pollution-heavy practices may resist adopting cleaner technologies, as addressing the problem could reduce profits.
4. **Subscription Models:** Offering temporary fixes or partial solutions to problems (e.g., software bugs or feature limitations) to encourage recurring payments.

### Alternate Terms

- **Conflict of Interest:** When profit motives conflict with the ethical obligation to solve the problem.
- **Rent-Seeking Behavior:** When companies profit without adding value, often by exploiting a systemic issue.
- **Problem Monetization:** Turning ongoing issues into revenue streams without addressing root causes.

These terms emphasize the economic and ethical challenges of such behavior.

## regulatory capture or policy exclusion

- highlights different aspects of how government regulations can inadvertently perpetuate problems or exclude certain groups.

---

### Key Terms and Explanations

1. **Regulatory Capture**  
   - **What it means:** When regulatory agencies are influenced or dominated by the industries or entities they are supposed to regulate, leading to rules that benefit specific groups at the expense of the public.
   - **Example:** Regulations that create high barriers to entry, favoring large, established companies while excluding smaller competitors or new entrants.

2. **Bureaucratic Inertia**  
   - **What it means:** The tendency of bureaucracies to resist change and stick with existing policies or processes, even if they are ineffective or harmful.
   - **Example:** Outdated licensing laws that prevent skilled workers from entering certain professions.

3. **Policy Exclusion**  
   - **What it means:** When regulations unintentionally or intentionally exclude certain populations or create unequal access to resources.
   - **Example:** Zoning laws that limit affordable housing, excluding low-income residents from certain areas.

4. **Unintended Consequences**  
   - **What it means:** When well-intentioned regulations result in outcomes that exacerbate the original problem or create new ones.
   - **Example:** Overly strict environmental regulations that drive businesses to relocate to less-regulated regions, increasing global emissions.

5. **Legal Pluralism**  
   - **What it means:** When overlapping or conflicting regulations create confusion and inefficiencies, making it difficult for individuals or organizations to comply or benefit.
   - **Example:** Contradictory local and federal policies on cannabis use that exclude certain groups from participating in legal markets.

These terms reflect how regulations can sometimes serve entrenched interests, become outdated, or fail to address systemic inequities.

## disaster capitalism or profiteering from crises

- examples: insurance fake food proprietary hardware or software

### Explanation

- **Disaster Capitalism:** Coined by author Naomi Klein, this term refers to the practice of capitalizing on crises (natural disasters, economic crashes, or pandemics) to push through policies or business strategies that increase profits, often at the expense of those affected.
- **Profiteering from Crises:** Refers to deriving excessive or opportunistic profits from disastrous events, often seen as ethically questionable.

### Why It's Relevant

In the case of a CEO excited about disasters increasing insurance policy sales:

- Natural disasters lead to heightened awareness of risk, prompting more people to purchase insurance.
- While legitimate business operations might expand during such times, celebrating the disasters themselves can reveal a prioritization of profit over empathy or social responsibility.

### Related Terms

1. **Moral Hazard:** When a company benefits from a risky or harmful situation without bearing the consequences (e.g., benefiting from increased risk awareness without addressing systemic risks).
2. **Crisis Exploitation:** Using a crisis as an opportunity to boost profits or implement strategies that wouldn't be accepted otherwise.
3. **Ethical Blindness:** Failing to consider the ethical implications of benefiting from others' misfortunes.

## data colonialism or digital colonialism

- captch was and still is using the public to train ocr character recognition and audio recognition and image recognition
- chat bots are colonizing users
- any software that reports home
- vscode telemetry
- all of googles products the browser
- operating systems

### Explanation

- **Data Colonialism:** A concept that draws parallels between historical colonialism and the modern extraction of data. In this context, users are seen as a resource to be "mined" for data, which is then used to train and improve proprietary software (e.g., AI models), often without fair compensation or consent.
- **Digital Colonialism:** Emphasizes the power imbalance where corporations dominate users and their digital environments, using them to fuel profit-driven algorithms while offering limited transparency or control.

---

### Characteristics

1. **Exploitation of User Data:**
   - Users provide data (intentionally or unintentionally) that is used to train machine learning models, often without adequate compensation.
   - Example: Social media companies using uploaded photos to improve facial recognition algorithms.

2. **Asymmetrical Power Dynamics:**
   - Users lack meaningful control over how their data is used or the ability to opt out.
   - Example: Free software or services that monetize user activity instead of offering fair trade-offs.

3. **Opaque Consent Mechanisms:**
   - Terms of service agreements often bury data usage details, making it difficult for users to fully understand their participation.
   - Example: AI chatbots improving their language models by analyzing user conversations without explicit consent.

---

### Related Terms

1. **Surveillance Capitalism:** The commodification of personal data for profit, often without users' full understanding or agreement.
2. **Crowdsourced Labor:** When users unwittingly provide unpaid labor by interacting with software (e.g., solving CAPTCHAs to train AI models).
3. **Tech Colonialism:** A broader term referring to global inequalities in how technology is developed, deployed, and exploited.

These terms critique the extractive practices of modern software corporations and highlight the need for ethical frameworks in data usage.
